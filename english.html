<h2>Free hikes on the Salève</h2>
<p>Every Sunday, let's go hiking (a gradient of 800 meters, 3 hours hike-up). Meeting at 10 am <a href="/infos-pratiques">at the terminus of bus No 8 at Veyrier-Douane</a> (route du Pas-de-l'Echelle 111, 1255 Veyrier not at Veyrier-Tournettes), 100 metres from the border in Switzerland, departure at 10H05 sharp (we are waiting for the bus leaving Cornavin station at 9:43 am). A volunteer guide (excursion leader) of the Association Genevoise des Amis du Salève (AGAS) welcomes you in all weather. No prior registration necessary.
Depending on the number of volunteer guides present, <a href="/itineraires">several routes may be offered.</a>
Depending on the route chosen, you will expect a 5 to 8 hours hike. Departure of the hike from the meeting point. Hiking boots (crampons in winter if ice, hat and solar protection lotion in summer), raincoat, passport, money, picnic and something to drink as well as good health are indispensable.
</p>
  
<div class="box-warning">
<p>You must absolutely <strong>be in good physical condition</strong> and have appropriate footwear (no sandals, flip-flops, etc!) The Salève is a real mountain, the second deadliest after the Mont-Blanc in Haute-Savoie.
<br>Be sure to bring enough water as there are no sources along the hiking paths on the Salève.</p>
</div>

<h2>Free Saturdays (unaccompanied)</h2>
<p>People interested in hiking the Saleve Saturday (without the presence of an official of the AGAS) can come on Saturdays at 10 am at the terminus of bus No 8 at Veyrier-Douane (route du Pas-de-l'Echelle 111, 1255 Veyrier not at Veyrier-Tournettes), 100 metres from the border on the Swiss side, departure at 10:03 .</p>
